Lentils,Bell Pepper,"Bell peppers are very rich in vitamin C. When eaten with lentils, this vitamin converts plant iron into a form your body absorbs more easily, improving overall iron status.",2025-10-05T07:14:51.440469

Kidney Beans,Beef,"Beef provides the ‘MFP factor’ (from Meat, Fish, Poultry), which helps your body absorb more of the non-heme iron present in kidney beans when they are eaten together.",2025-10-05T07:14:51.440469
Iron-Fortified Cereal,Orange Juice,"Orange juice supplies vitamin C that supports the uptake of added (fortified) iron in cereal, increasing the amount of iron your body can use from the breakfast.",2025-10-05T07:14:51.440469
Tofu (Calcium-set),Salmon,"Salmon naturally contains vitamin D. Vitamin D promotes intestinal calcium absorption, so eating salmon with calcium-set tofu helps your body make better use of the tofu’s calcium.",2025-10-05T07:14:51.440469
