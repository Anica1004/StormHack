Spinach,Orange,"Vitamin C in oranges markedly enhances the absorption of non-heme iron from spinach, which by itself is absorbed poorly. Pairing them can help raise total iron uptake from the meal."
Lentils,Bell Pepper,"Bell peppers are very rich in vitamin C. When eaten with lentils, this vitamin converts plant iron into a form your body absorbs more easily, improving overall iron status."
Chickpeas,Lemon Juice,"Squeezing lemon juice over chickpeas adds acid and vitamin C, both of which make the non-heme iron in chickpeas easier for the body to absorb during digestion."
Kidney Beans,Beef,"Beef provides the ‘MFP factor’ (from Meat, Fish, Poultry), which helps your body absorb more of the non-heme iron present in kidney beans when they are eaten together."
Cereal,Orange Juice,"Orange juice supplies vitamin C that supports the uptake of added (fortified) iron in cereal, increasing the amount of iron your body can use from the breakfast."
Tofu,Salmon,"Salmon naturally contains vitamin D. Vitamin D promotes intestinal calcium absorption, so eating salmon with calcium-set tofu helps your body make better use of the tofu’s calcium."
Milk,Egg,"Egg yolks contain vitamin D, which supports your body’s ability to absorb and utilize calcium from milk, contributing to healthier bones and teeth."
Kale,Olive Oil,Vitamin K in kale is fat‑soluble. Consuming kale with olive oil helps the vitamin dissolve into dietary fats and get packaged for absorption in the intestines.
Carrot,Olive Oil,"Carrots are rich in beta‑carotene, a fat‑soluble precursor to vitamin A. Eating carrots with olive oil improves micelle formation and increases beta‑carotene absorption."
Tomato,Olive Oil,Tomatoes contain carotenoids such as lycopene that are better absorbed in the presence of fat. Adding olive oil helps more lycopene get into the bloodstream.
