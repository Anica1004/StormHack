Spinach,Milk,"Spinach contains oxalates that bind to calcium in milk, forming compounds your body cannot absorb well. This reduces how much calcium you get from the meal."
Spinach,Tofu,"Oxalates in spinach also attach to the calcium in calcium‑set tofu, limiting the amount of calcium that can be taken up during digestion."
Milk,Spinach,"Calcium from milk competes with non‑heme iron from spinach at the absorption stage, so taking them together can lower iron uptake from the spinach."
Milk,Lentils,"When milk is consumed with lentils, calcium can interfere with the absorption of the lentils’ non‑heme iron, reducing the iron your body retains."
Milk,Chickpeas,"The calcium in milk can blunt the absorption of plant‑based iron from chickpeas, which may matter for people who rely on legumes for their iron needs."
Milk,Kidney Beans,Drinking milk with kidney beans can reduce the efficiency of non‑heme iron absorption from the beans due to calcium’s inhibitory effect.
Milk,Cereal,"Calcium present in milk can hinder the absorption of the iron added to fortified cereal, lessening the benefit of the fortification."
Milk,Beef,"Although beef provides well‑absorbed heme iron, calcium from milk can still interfere with iron uptake, lowering the total iron absorbed from the meal."
Tofu,Lentils,"Calcium in tofu can reduce the absorption of non‑heme iron from lentils when eaten at the same time, diminishing iron availability."
Tofu,Chickpeas,Eating calcium‑set tofu alongside chickpeas may lower iron absorption from the chickpeas due to calcium’s competitive effect in the intestines.
